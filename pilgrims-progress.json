			"chaptertext": "When at the first I took my pen in hand\nThus for to write, I did not understand\nThat I at all should make a little book\nIn such a mode; nay, I had undertook\nTo make another; which, when almost done,\nBefore I was aware, I this begun.\n\nAnd thus it was: I, writing of the way\nAnd race of saints, in this our gospel day,\nFell suddenly into an allegory\nAbout their journey, and the way to glory,\nIn more than twenty things which I set down.\nThis done, I twenty more had in my crown;\nAnd they again began to multiply,\nLike sparks that from the coals of fire do fly.\n\nNay, then, thought I, if that you breed so fast,\nI'll put you by yourselves, lest you at last\nShould prove ad infinitum, and eat out\nThe book that I already am about.\n\nWell, so I did; but yet I did not think\nTo shew to all the world my pen and ink\nIn such a mode; I only thought to make\nI knew not what; nor did I undertake\nThereby to please my neighbour: no, not I;\nI did it my own self to gratify.\n\nNeither did I but vacant seasons spend\nIn this my scribble; nor did I intend\nBut to divert myself in doing this\nFrom worser thoughts which make me do amiss.\n\nThus, I set pen to paper with delight,\nAnd quickly had my thoughts in black and white.\nFor, having now my method by the end,\nStill as I pulled, it came; and so I penned\nIt down: until it came at last to be,\nFor length and breadth, the bigness which you see.\n\nWell, when I had thus put mine ends together,\nI shewed them others, that I might see whether\nThey would condemn them, or them justify:\nAnd some said, Let them live; some, Let them die;\nSome said, JOHN, print it; others said, Not so;\nSome said, It might do good; others said, No.\n\nNow was I in a strait, and did not see\nWhich was the best thing to be done by me:\nAt last I thought, Since you are thus divided,\nI print it will, and so the case decided.\n\nFor, thought I, some, I see, would have it done,\nThough others in that channel do not run:\nTo prove, then, who advised for the best,\nThus I thought fit to put it to the test.\n\nI further thought, if now I did deny\nThose that would have it, thus to gratify.\nI did not know but hinder them I might\nOf that which would to them be great delight.\n\nFor those which were not for its coming forth,\nI said to them, Offend you I am loth,\nYet, since your brethren pleased with it be,\nForbear to judge till you do further see.\n\nIf that thou wilt not read, let it alone;\nSome love the meat, some love to pick the bone.\nYea, that I might them better palliate,\nI did too with them thus expostulate:--\n\nMay I not write in such a style as this?\nIn such a method, too, and yet not miss\nMy end--thy good? Why may it not be done?\nDark clouds bring waters, when the bright bring none.\nYea, dark or bright, if they their silver drops\nCause to descend, the earth, by yielding crops,\nGives praise to both, and carpeth not at either,\nBut treasures up the fruit they yield together;\nYea, so commixes both, that in her fruit\nNone can distinguish this from that: they suit\nHer well when hungry; but, if she be full,\nShe spews out both, and makes their blessings null.\n\nYou see the ways the fisherman doth take\nTo catch the fish; what engines doth he make?\nBehold how he engageth all his wits;\nAlso his snares, lines, angles, hooks, and nets;\nYet fish there be, that neither hook, nor line,\nNor snare, nor net, nor engine can make thine:\nThey must be groped for, and be tickled too,\nOr they will not be catch'd, whate'er you do.\n\nHow does the fowler seek to catch his game\nBy divers means! all which one cannot name:\nHis guns, his nets, his lime-twigs, light, and bell:\nHe creeps, he goes, he stands; yea, who can tell\nOf all his postures? Yet there's none of these\nWill make him master of what fowls he please.\nYea, he must pipe and whistle to catch this,\nYet, if he does so, that bird he will miss.\n\nIf that a pearl may in a toad's head dwell,\nAnd may be found too in an oyster-shell;\nIf things that promise nothing do contain\nWhat better is than gold; who will disdain,\nThat have an inkling of it, there to look,\nThat they may find it? Now, my little book,\n(Though void of all these paintings that may make\nIt with this or the other man to take)\nIs not without those things that do excel\nWhat do in brave but empty notions dwell.\n\n'Well, yet I am not fully satisfied,\nThat this your book will stand, when soundly tried.'\nWhy, what's the matter? 'It is dark.' What though?\n'But it is feigned.' What of that? I trow?\nSome men, by feigned words, as dark as mine,\nMake truth to spangle and its rays to shine.\n\n'But they want solidness.' Speak, man, thy mind.\n'They drown the weak; metaphors make us blind.'\n\nSolidity, indeed, becomes the pen\nOf him that writeth things divine to men;\nBut must I needs want solidness, because\nBy metaphors I speak? Were not God's laws,\nHis gospel laws, in olden times held forth\nBy types, shadows, and metaphors? Yet loth\nWill any sober man be to find fault\nWith them, lest he be found for to assault\nThe highest wisdom. No, he rather stoops,\nAnd seeks to find out what by pins and loops,\nBy calves and sheep, by heifers and by rams,\nBy birds and herbs, and by the blood of lambs,\nGod speaketh to him; and happy is he\nThat finds the light and grace that in them be.\n\nBe not too forward, therefore, to conclude\nThat I want solidness--that I am rude;\nAll things solid in show not solid be;\nAll things in parables despise not we;\nLest things most hurtful lightly we receive,\nAnd things that good are, of our souls bereave.\n\nMy dark and cloudy words, they do but hold\nThe truth, as cabinets enclose the gold.\n\nThe prophets used much by metaphors\nTo set forth truth; yea, who so considers Christ,\nhis apostles too, shall plainly see,\nThat truths to this day in such mantles be.\n\nAm I afraid to say, that holy writ,\nWhich for its style and phrase puts down all wit,\nIs everywhere so full of all these things--\nDark figures, allegories? Yet there springs\nFrom that same book that lustre, and those rays\nOf light, that turn our darkest nights to days.\n\nCome, let my carper to his life now look,\nAnd find there darker lines than in my book\nHe findeth any; yea, and let him know,\nThat in his best things there are worse lines too.\n\nMay we but stand before impartial men,\nTo his poor one I dare adventure ten,\nThat they will take my meaning in these lines\nFar better than his lies in silver shrines.\nCome, truth, although in swaddling clouts, I find,\nInforms the judgement, rectifies the mind;\nPleases the understanding, makes the will\nSubmit; the memory too it doth fill\nWith what doth our imaginations please;\nLikewise it tends our troubles to appease.\n\nSound words, I know, Timothy is to use,\nAnd old wives' fables he is to refuse;\nBut yet grave Paul him nowhere did forbid\nThe use of parables; in which lay hid\nThat gold, those pearls, and precious stones that were\nWorth digging for, and that with greatest care.\n\nLet me add one word more. O man of God,\nArt thou offended? Dost thou wish I had\nPut forth my matter in another dress?\nOr, that I had in things been more express?\nThree things let me propound; then I submit\nTo those that are my betters, as is fit.\n\nI find not that I am denied the use\nOf this my method, so I no abuse\nPut on the words, things, readers; or be rude\nIn handling figure or similitude,\nIn application; but, all that I may,\nSeek the advance of truth this or that way\nDenied, did I say? Nay, I have leave\n(Example too, and that from them that have\nGod better pleased, by their words or ways,\nThan any man that breatheth now-a-days)\nThus to express my mind, thus to declare\nThings unto thee that excellentest are.\n\nI find that men (as high as trees) will write\nDialogue-wise; yet no man doth them slight\nFor writing so: indeed, if they abuse\nTruth, cursed be they, and the craft they use\nTo that intent; but yet let truth be free\nTo make her sallies upon thee and me,\nWhich way it pleases God; for who knows how,\nBetter than he that taught us first to plough,\nTo guide our mind and pens for his design?\nAnd he makes base things usher in divine.\n\nI find that holy writ in many places\nHath semblance with this method, where the cases\nDo call for one thing, to set forth another;\nUse it I may, then, and yet nothing smother\nTruth's golden beams: nay, by this method may\nMake it cast forth its rays as light as day.\nAnd now before I do put up my pen,\nI'll shew the profit of my book, and then\nCommit both thee and it unto that Hand\nThat pulls the strong down, and makes weak ones stand.\n\nThis book it chalketh out before thine eyes\nThe man that seeks the everlasting prize;\nIt shews you whence he comes, whither he goes;\nWhat he leaves undone, also what he does;\nIt also shows you how he runs and runs,\nTill he unto the gate of glory comes.\n\nIt shows, too, who set out for life amain,\nAs if the lasting crown they would obtain;\nHere also you may see the reason why\nThey lose their labour, and like fools do die.\n\nThis book will make a traveller of thee,\nIf by its counsel thou wilt ruled be;\nIt will direct thee to the Holy Land,\nIf thou wilt its directions understand:\nYea, it will make the slothful active be;\nThe blind also delightful things to see.\n\nArt thou for something rare and profitable?\nWouldest thou see a truth within a fable?\nArt thou forgetful? Wouldest thou remember\nFrom New-Year's day to the last of December?\nThen read my fancies; they will stick like burs,\nAnd may be, to the helpless, comforters.\n\nThis book is writ in such a dialect\nAs may the minds of listless men affect:\nIt seems a novelty, and yet contains\nNothing but sound and honest gospel strains.\nWouldst thou divert thyself from melancholy?\nWouldst thou be pleasant, yet be far from folly?\nWouldst thou read riddles, and their explanation?\nOr else be drowned in thy contemplation?\nDost thou love picking meat? Or wouldst thou see\nA man in the clouds, and hear him speak to thee?\nWouldst thou be in a dream, and yet not sleep?\nOr wouldst thou in a moment laugh and weep?\nWouldest thou lose thyself and catch no harm,\nAnd find thyself again without a charm?\nWouldst read thyself, and read thou knowest not what,\nAnd yet know whether thou art blest or not,\n\nBy reading the same lines? Oh, then come hither,\nAnd lay my book, thy head, and heart together.\n\nJOHN BUNYAN"

			"chaptertext": "As I walked through the wilderness of this world, I lighted on a certain place where was a Den, and I laid me down in that place to sleep: and, as I slept, I dreamed a dream. I dreamed, and behold, I saw a man clothed with rags, standing in a certain place, with his face from his own house, a book in his hand, and a great burden upon his back. [Isaiah 64:6; Luke 14:33; Psalm 38:4; Habakkuk 2:2; Acts 16:30,31] I looked, and saw him open the book, and read therein; and, as he read, he wept, and trembled; and, not being able longer to contain, he brake out with a lamentable cry, saying, \"What shall I do?\" [Acts 2:37]\n\nIn this plight, therefore, he went home and refrained himself as long as he could, that his wife and children should not perceive his distress; but he could not be silent long, because that his trouble increased. Wherefore at length he brake his mind to his wife and children; and thus he began to talk to them: O my dear wife, said he, and you the children of my bowels, I, your dear friend, am in myself undone by reason of a burden that lieth hard upon me; moreover, I am for certain informed that this our city will be burned with fire from heaven; in which fearful overthrow, both myself, with thee my wife, and you my sweet babes, shall miserably come to ruin, except (the which yet I see not) some way of escape can be found, whereby we may be delivered. At this his relations were sore amazed; not for that they believed that what he had said to them was true, but because they thought that some frenzy distemper had got into his head; therefore, it drawing towards night, and they hoping that sleep might settle his brains, with all haste they got him to bed. But the night was as troublesome to him as the day; wherefore, instead of sleeping, he spent it in sighs and tears. So, when the morning was come, they would know how he did. He told them, Worse and worse: he also set to talking to them again; but they began to be hardened. They also thought to drive away his distemper by harsh and surly carriages to him; sometimes they would deride, sometimes they would chide, and sometimes they would quite neglect him. Wherefore he began to retire himself to his chamber, to pray for and pity them, and also to condole his own misery; he would also walk solitarily in the fields, sometimes reading, and sometimes praying: and thus for some days he spent his time.\n\nNow, I saw, upon a time, when he was walking in the fields, that he was, as he was wont, reading in his book, and greatly distressed in his mind; and, as he read, he burst out, as he had done before, crying, \"What shall I do to be saved?\"\n\nI saw also that he looked this way and that way, as if he would run; yet he stood still, because, as I perceived, he could not tell which way to go. I looked then, and saw a man named Evangelist coming to him and asked, Wherefore dost thou cry? [Job 33:23]\n\nHe answered, Sir, I perceive by the book in my hand, that I am condemned to die, and after that to come to judgement [Hebrews 9:27]; and I find that I am not willing to do the first [Job 16:21], nor able to do the second. [Ezekiel 22:14]\n\nCHRISTIAN no sooner leaves the World but meets EVANGELIST, who lovingly him greets With tidings of another: and doth show Him how to mount to that from this below.\n\nThen said Evangelist, Why not willing to die, since this life is attended with so many evils? The man answered, Because I fear that this burden is upon my back will sink me lower than the grave, and I shall fall into Tophet. [Isaiah 30:33] And, Sir, if I be not fit to go to prison, I am not fit, I am sure, to go to judgement, and from thence to execution; and the thoughts of these things make me cry.\n\nThen said Evangelist, If this be thy condition, why standest thou still? He answered, Because I know not whither to go. Then he gave him a parchment roll, and there was written within, Flee from the wrath to come. [Matthew 3.7]\n\nThe man therefore read it, and looking upon Evangelist very carefully, said, Whither must I fly? Then said Evangelist, pointing with his finger over a very wide field, Do you see yonder wicket-gate? [Matthew 7:13,14] The man said, No. Then said the other, Do you see yonder shining light? [Psalm 119:105; 2 Peter 1:19] He said, I think I do. Then said Evangelist, Keep that light in your eye, and go up directly thereto: so shalt thou see the gate; at which, when thou knockest, it shall be told thee what thou shalt do.\n\nSo I saw in my dream that the man began to run.\n\nNow, he had not run far from his own door, but his wife and children, perceiving it, began to cry after him to return; but the man put his fingers in his ears, and ran on, crying, Life! life! eternal life! [Luke 14:26] So he looked not behind him, but fled towards the middle of the plain. [Genesis 19:17]\n\nThe neighbours also came out to see him run [Jeremiah 20:10]; and, as he ran, some mocked, others threatened, and some cried after him to return; and, among those that did so, there were two that resolved to fetch him back by force. The name of the one was Obstinate and the name of the other Pliable. Now, by this time, the man was got a good distance from them; but, however, they were resolved to pursue him, which they did, and in a little time they overtook him. Then said the man, Neighbours, wherefore are ye come? They said, To persuade you to go back with us. But he said, That can by no means be; you dwell, said he, in the City of Destruction, the place also where I was born: I see it to be so; and, dying there, sooner or later, you will sink lower than the grave, into a place that burns with fire and brimstone: be content, good neighbours, and go along with me.\n\nOBST. What! said Obstinate, and leave our friends and our comforts behind us?\n\nCHR. Yes, said Christian, for that was his name, because that ALL which you shall forsake is not worthy to be compared with a little of that which I am seeking to enjoy [2 Corinthians 4:18]; and, if you will go along with me, and hold it, you shall fare as I myself; for there, where I go, is enough and to spare. [Luke 15:17] Come away, and prove my words.\n\nOBST. What are the things you seek, since you leave all the world to find them?\n\nCHR. I seek an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away [1 Peter 1:4], and it is laid up in heaven, and safe there [Hebrews 11:16], to be bestowed, at the time appointed, on them that diligently seek it. Read it so, if you will, in my book.\n\nOBST. Tush! said Obstinate, away with your book; will you go back with us or no?\n\nCHR. No, not I, said the other, because I have laid my hand to the plough. [Luke 9:62]\n\nOBST. Come, then, neighbour Pliable, let us turn again, and go home without him; there is a company of these crazy-headed coxcombs, that, when they take a fancy by the end, are wiser in their own eyes than seven men that can render a reason. [Proverbs 26:16]\n\nPLI. Then said Pliable, Don't revile; if what the good Christian says is true, the things he looks after are better than ours: my heart inclines to go with my neighbour.\n\nOBST. What! more fools still! Be ruled by me, and go back; who knows whither such a brain-sick fellow will lead you? Go back, go back, and be wise.\n\nCHR. Nay, but do thou come with thy neighbour, Pliable; there are such things to be had which I spoke of, and many more glorious besides. If you believe not me, read here in this book; and for the truth of what is expressed therein, behold, all is confirmed by the blood of Him that made it. [Hebrews 9:17-22; 13:20]\n\nPLI. Well, neighbour Obstinate, said Pliable, I begin to come to a point; I intend to go along with this good man, and to cast in my lot with him: but, my good companion, do you know the way to this desired place?\n\nCHR. I am directed by a man, whose name is Evangelist, to speed me to a little gate that is before us, where we shall receive instructions about the way.\n\nPLI. Come, then, good neighbour, let us be going. Then they went both together.\n\nOBST. And I will go back to my place, said Obstinate; I will be no companion of such misled, fantastical fellows.\n\nNow, I saw in my dream, that when Obstinate was gone back, Christian and Pliable went talking over the plain; and thus they began their discourse.\n\nCHR. Come, neighbour Pliable, how do you do? I am glad you are persuaded to go along with me. Had even Obstinate himself but felt what I have felt of the powers and terrors of what is yet unseen, he would not thus lightly have given us the back.\n\nPLI. Come, neighbour Christian, since there are none but us two here, tell me now further what the things are, and how to be enjoyed, whither we are going.\n\nCHR. I can better conceive of them with my mind, than speak of them with my tongue. God's things unspeakable: but yet, since you are desirous to know, I will read of them in my book.\n\nPLI. And do you think that the words of your book are certainly true?\n\nCHR. Yes, verily; for it was made by Him that cannot lie. [Titus 1:2]\n\nPLI. Well said; what things are they?\n\nCHR. There is an endless kingdom to be inhabited, and everlasting life to be given us, that we may inhabit that kingdom for ever. [Isaiah 45:17; John 10:28,29]\n\nPLI. Well said; and what else?\n\nCHR. There are crowns and glory to be given us, and garments that will make us shine like the sun in the firmament of heaven. [2 Timothy 4:8; Revelation 3:4; Matthew 13:43]\n\nPLI. This is very pleasant; and what else?\n\nCHR. There shall be no more crying, nor Sorrow: for He that is owner of the place will wipe all tears from our eyes. [Isaiah 25.6-8; Revelation 7:17, 21:4]\n\nPLI. And what company shall we have there?\n\nCHR. There we shall be with seraphims and cherubims, creatures that will dazzle your eyes to look on them. [Isa. 6:2] There also you shall meet with thousands and ten thousands that have gone before us to that place; none of them are hurtful, but loving and holy; every one walking in the sight of God, and standing in his presence with acceptance for ever. [1 Thess. 4:16,17; Rev. 5:11] In a word, there we shall see the elders with their golden crowns [Rev. 4:4], there we shall see the holy virgins with their golden harps [Rev. 14:1-5], there we shall see men that by the world were cut in pieces, burnt in flames, eaten of beasts, drowned in the seas, for the love that they bare to the Lord of the place, all well, and clothed with immortality as with a garment. [John 12:25; 2 Cor. 5:4]\n\nPLI. The hearing of this is enough to ravish one's heart. But are these things to be enjoyed? How shall we get to be sharers thereof?\n\nCHR. The Lord, the Governor of the country, hath recorded that in this book; the substance of which is, If we be truly willing to have it, he will bestow it upon us freely.\n\nPLI. Well, my good companion, glad am I to hear of these things: come on, let us mend our pace.\n\nCHR. I cannot go so fast as I would, by reason of this burden that is on my back.\n\nNow I saw in my dream, that just as they had ended this talk they drew near to a very miry slough, that was in the midst of the plain; and they, being heedless, did both fall suddenly into the bog. The name of the slough was Despond. Here, therefore, they wallowed for a time, being grievously bedaubed with the dirt; and Christian, because of the burden that was on his back, began to sink in the mire.\n\nPLI. Then said Pliable; Ah! neighbour Christian, where are you now?\n\nCHR. Truly, said Christian, I do not know.\n\nPLI. At this Pliable began to be offended, and angrily said to his fellow, Is this the happiness you have told me all this while of? If we have such ill speed at our first setting out, what may we expect betwixt this and our journey's end? May I get out again with my life, you shall possess the brave country alone for me. And, with that, he gave a desperate struggle or two, and got out of the mire on that side of the slough which was next to his own house: so away he went, and Christian saw him no more.\n\nWherefore Christian was left to tumble in the Slough of Despond alone: but still he endeavoured to struggle to that side of the slough that was still further from his own house, and next to the wicket-gate; the which he did, but could not get out, because of the burden that was upon his back: but I beheld in my dream, that a man came to him, whose name was Help, and asked him, What he did there?\n\nCHR. Sir, said Christian, I was bid go this way by a man called Evangelist, who directed me also to yonder gate, that I might escape the wrath to come; and as I was going thither I fell in here.\n\nHELP. But why did not you look for the steps?\n\nCHR. Fear followed me so hard, that I fled the next way, and fell in.\n\nHELP. Then said he, Give me thy hand: so he gave him his hand, and he drew him out, and set him upon sound ground, and bid him go on his way. [Psalm 40:2]\n\nThen I stepped to him that plucked him out, and said, Sir, wherefore, since over this place is the way from the City of Destruction to yonder gate, is it that this plat is not mended, that poor travellers might go thither with more security? And he said unto me, This miry slough is such a place as cannot be mended; it is the descent whither the scum and filth that attends conviction for sin doth continually run, and therefore it is called the Slough of Despond; for still, as the sinner is awakened about his lost condition, there ariseth in his soul many fears, and doubts, and discouraging apprehensions, which all of them get together, and settle in this place. And this is the reason of the badness of this ground.\n\nIt is not the pleasure of the King that this place should remain so bad. [Isaiah 35:3,4] His labourers also have, by the direction of His Majesty's surveyors, been for above these sixteen hundred years employed about this patch of ground, if perhaps it might have been mended: yea, and to my knowledge, said he, here have been swallowed up at least twenty thousand cart-loads, yea, millions of wholesome instructions, that have at all seasons been brought from all places of the King's dominions, and they that can tell, say they are the best materials to make good ground of the place; if so be, it might have been mended, but it is the Slough of Despond still, and so will be when they have done what they can.\n\nTrue, there are, by the direction of the Law-giver, certain good and substantial steps, placed even through the very midst of this slough; but at such time as this place doth much spew out its filth, as it doth against change of weather, these steps are hardly seen; or, if they be, men, through the dizziness of their heads, step beside, and then they are bemired to purpose, notwithstanding the steps be there; but the ground is good when they are once got in at the gate. [1 Samuel 12:23]\n\nNow, I saw in my dream, that by this time Pliable was got home to his house again, so that his neighbours came to visit him; and some of them called him wise man for coming back, and some called him fool for hazarding himself with Christian: others again did mock at his cowardliness; saying, Surely, since you began to venture, I would not have been so base to have given out for a few difficulties. So Pliable sat sneaking among them. But at last he got more confidence, and then they all turned their tales, and began to deride poor Christian behind his back. And thus much concerning Pliable.\n\nNow, as Christian was walking solitarily by himself, he espied one afar off, come crossing over the field to meet him; and their hap was to meet just as they were crossing the way of each other. The gentleman's name that met him was Mr. Worldly Wiseman, he dwelt in the town of Carnal Policy, a very great town, and also hard by from whence Christian came. This man, then, meeting with Christian, and having some inkling of him,--for Christian's setting forth from the City of Destruction was much noised abroad, not only in the town where he dwelt, but also it began to be the town talk in some other places,--Mr. Worldly Wiseman, therefore, having some guess of him, by beholding his laborious going, by observing his sighs and groans, and the like, began thus to enter into some talk with Christian.\n\nWORLD. How now, good fellow, whither away after this burdened manner?\n\nCHR. A burdened manner, indeed, as ever, I think, poor creature had! And whereas you ask me, Whither away? I tell you, Sir, I am going to yonder wicket-gate before me; for there, as I am informed, I shall be put into a way to be rid of my heavy burden.\n\nWORLD. Hast thou a wife and children?\n\nCHR. Yes; but I am so laden with this burden that I cannot take that pleasure in them as formerly; methinks I am as if I had none. [1 Cor 7:29]\n\nWORLD. Wilt thou hearken unto me if I give thee counsel?\n\nCHR. If it be good, I will; for I stand in need of good counsel.\n\nWORLD. I would advise thee, then, that thou with all speed get thyself rid of thy burden; for thou wilt never be settled in thy mind till then; nor canst thou enjoy the benefits of the blessing which God hath bestowed upon thee till then.\n\nCHR. That is that which I seek for, even to be rid of this heavy burden; but get it off myself, I cannot; nor is there any man in our country that can take it off my shoulders; therefore am I going this way, as I told you, that I may be rid of my burden.\n\nWORLD. Who bid thee go this way to be rid of thy burden?\n\nCHR. A man that appeared to me to be a very great and honourable person; his name, as I remember, is Evangelist.\n\nWORLD. I beshrew him for his counsel! there is not a more dangerous and troublesome way in the world than is that unto which he hath directed thee; and that thou shalt find, if thou wilt be ruled by his counsel. Thou hast met with something, as I perceive, already; for I see the dirt of the Slough of Despond is upon thee; but that slough is the beginning of the sorrows that do attend those that go on in that way. Hear me, I am older than thou; thou art like to meet with, in the way which thou goest, wearisomeness, painfulness, hunger, perils, nakedness, sword, lions, dragons, darkness, and, in a word, death, and what not! These things are certainly true, having been confirmed by many testimonies. And why should a man so carelessly cast away himself, by giving heed to a stranger?\n\nCHR. Why, Sir, this burden upon my back is more terrible to me than all these things which you have mentioned; nay, methinks I care not what I meet with in the way, if so be I can also meet with deliverance from my burden.\n\nWORLD. How camest thou by the burden at first?\n\nCHR. By reading this book in my hand.\n\nWORLD. I thought so; and it is happened unto thee as to other weak men, who, meddling with things too high for them, do suddenly fall into thy distractions; which distractions do not only unman men, as thine, I perceive, have done thee, but they run them upon desperate ventures to obtain they know not what.\n\nCHR. I know what I would obtain; it is ease for my heavy burden.\n\nWORLD. But why wilt thou seek for ease this way, seeing so many dangers attend it? especially since, hadst thou but patience to hear me, I could direct thee to the obtaining of what thou desirest, without the dangers that thou in this way wilt run thyself into; yea, and the remedy is at hand. Besides, I will add, that instead of those dangers, thou shalt meet with much safety, friendship, and content.\n\nCHR. Pray, Sir, open this secret to me.\n\nWORLD. Why, in yonder village--the village is named Morality-- there dwells a gentleman whose name is Legality, a very judicious man, and a man of very good name, that has skill to help men off with such burdens as thine are from their shoulders: yea, to my knowledge, he hath done a great deal of good this way; ay, and besides, he hath skill to cure those that are somewhat crazed in their wits with their burdens. To him, as I said, thou mayest go, and be helped presently. His house is not quite a mile from this place, and if he should not be at home himself, he hath a pretty young man to his son, whose name is Civility, that can do it (to speak on) as well as the old gentleman himself; there, I say, thou mayest be eased of thy burden; and if thou art not minded to go back to thy former habitation, as, indeed, I would not wish thee, thou mayest send for thy wife and children to thee to this village, where there are houses now stand empty, one of which thou mayest have at reasonable rates; provision is there also cheap and good; and that which will make thy life the more happy is, to be sure, there thou shalt live by honest neighbours, in credit and good fashion.\n\nNow was Christian somewhat at a stand; but presently he concluded, if this be true, which this gentleman hath said, my wisest course is to take his advice; and with that he thus further spoke.\n\nCHR. Sir, which is my way to this honest man's house?\n\nWORLD. Do you see yonder hill?\n\nCHR. Yes, very well.\n\nWORLD. By that hill you must go, and the first house you come at is his.\n\nSo Christian turned out of his way to go to Mr. Legality's house for help; but, behold, when he was got now hard by the hill, it seemed so high, and also that side of it that was next the wayside did hang so much over, that Christian was afraid to venture further, lest the hill should fall on his head; wherefore there he stood still and wotted not what to do. Also his burden now seemed heavier to him than while he was in his way. There came also flashes of fire out of the hill, that made Christian afraid that he should be burned. [Exodus 19:16, 18] Here, therefore, he sweat and did quake for fear. [Hebrews 12:21]\n\nWhen Christians unto carnal men give ear, Out of their way they go, and pay for 't dear; For Master Worldly Wiseman can but shew A saint the way to bondage and to woe.\n\nAnd now he began to be sorry that he had taken Mr. Worldly Wiseman's counsel. And with that he saw Evangelist coming to meet him; at the sight also of whom he began to blush for shame. So Evangelist drew nearer and nearer; and coming up to him, he looked upon him with a severe and dreadful countenance, and thus began to reason with Christian.\n\nEVAN. What dost thou here, Christian? said he: at which words Christian knew not what to answer; wherefore at present he stood speechless before him. Then said Evangelist further, Art not thou the man that I found crying without the walls of the City of Destruction?\n\nCHR. Yes, dear Sir, I am the man.\n\nEVAN. Did not I direct thee the way to the little wicket-gate?\n\nCHR. Yes, dear Sir, said Christian.\n\nEVAN. How is it, then, that thou art so quickly turned aside? for thou art now out of the way.\n\nCHR. I met with a gentleman so soon as I had got over the Slough of Despond, who persuaded me that I might, in the village before me, find a man that would take off my burden.\n\nEVAN. What was he?\n\nCHR. He looked like a gentleman, and talked much to me, and got me at last to yield; so I came hither; but when I beheld this hill, and how it hangs over the way, I suddenly made a stand lest it should fall on my head.\n\nEVAN. What said that gentleman to you?\n\nCHR. Why, he asked me whither I was going, and I told him.\n\nEVAN. And what said he then?\n\nCHR. He asked me if I had a family? And I told him. But, said I, I am so loaden with the burden that is on my back, that I cannot take pleasure in them as formerly.\n\nEVAN. And what said he then?\n\nCHR. He bid me with speed get rid of my burden; and I told him that it was ease that I sought. And said I, I am therefore going to yonder gate, to receive further direction how I may get to the place of deliverance. So he said that he would shew me a better way, and short, not so attended with difficulties as the way, Sir, that you set me in; which way, said he, will direct you to a gentleman's house that hath skill to take off these burdens, so I believed him, and turned out of that way into this, if haply I might be soon eased of my burden. But when I came to this place, and beheld things as they are, I stopped for fear (as I said) of danger: but I now know not what to do.\n\nEVAN. Then, said Evangelist, stand still a little, that I may show thee the words of God. So he stood trembling. Then said Evangelist, \"See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven.\" [Hebrews 12:25] He said, moreover, \"Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.\" [Hebrews 10:38] He also did thus apply them: Thou art the man that art running into this misery; thou hast begun to reject the counsel of the Most High, and to draw back thy foot from the way of peace, even almost to the hazarding of thy perdition.\n\nThen Christian fell down at his feet as dead, crying, \"Woe is me, for I am undone!\" At the sight of which Evangelist caught him by the right hand, saying, \"All manner of sin and blasphemies shall be forgiven unto men.\" [Matthew 12:31, Mark 3:28] \"Be not faithless, but believing.\" [John 20:27] Then did Christian again a little revive, and stood up trembling, as at first, before Evangelist.\n\nThen Evangelist proceeded, saying, Give more earnest heed to the things that I shall tell thee of. I will now show thee who it was that deluded thee, and who it was also to whom he sent thee. --The man that met thee is one Worldly Wiseman, and rightly is he so called; partly, because he savoureth only the doctrine of this world, [1 John 4:5] (therefore he always goes to the town of Morality to church): and partly because he loveth that doctrine best, for it saveth him best from the cross. [Galatians 6:12] And because he is of this carnal temper, therefore he seeketh to pervert my ways, though right. Now there are three things in this man's counsel, that thou must utterly abhor.\n\n1. His turning thee out of the way. 2. His labouring to render the cross odious to thee. And, 3. His setting thy feet in that way that leadeth unto the administration of death.\n\nFirst, Thou must abhor his turning thee out of the way; and thine own consenting thereunto: because this is to reject the counsel of God for the sake of the counsel of a Worldly Wiseman. The Lord says, \"Strive to enter in at the strait gate\" [Luke 13:24], the gate to which I sent thee; for \"strait is the gate that leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.\" [Matthew 7:14] From this little wicket-gate, and from the way thereto, hath this wicked man turned thee, to the bringing of thee almost to destruction; hate, therefore, his turning thee out of the way, and abhor thyself for hearkening to him.\n\nSecondly, Thou must abhor his labouring to render the cross odious unto thee; for thou art to prefer it \"before the treasures in Egypt.\" [Hebrews 11:25,26] Besides the King of glory hath told thee, that he that \"will save his life shall lose it.\" [Mark 8:35; John 12:25; Matthew 10:39] And, \"He that cometh after me, and hateth not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.\" [Luke 14:26] I say, therefore, for man to labour to persuade thee, that that shall be thy death, without which, THE TRUTH hath said, thou canst not have eternal life; this doctrine thou must abhor.\n\nThirdly, Thou must hate his setting of thy feet in the way that leadeth to the ministration of death. And for this thou must consider to whom he sent thee, and also how unable that person was to deliver thee from thy burden.\n\nHe to whom thou wast sent for ease, being by name Legality, is the son of the bond-woman which now is, and is in bondage with her children [Galatians 4:21-27]; and is, in a mystery, this Mount Sinai, which thou hast feared will fall on thy head. Now, if she, with her children, are in bondage, how canst thou expect by them to be made free? This Legality, therefore, is not able to set thee free from thy burden. No man was as yet ever rid of his burden by him; no, nor ever is like to be: ye cannot be justified by the works of the law; for by the deeds of the law no man living can be rid of his burden: therefore, Mr. Worldly Wiseman is an alien, and Mr. Legality is a cheat; and for his son Civility, notwithstanding his simpering looks, he is but a hypocrite and cannot help thee. Believe me, there is nothing in all this noise, that thou hast heard of these sottish men, but a design to beguile thee of thy salvation, by turning thee from the way in which I had set thee. After this, Evangelist called aloud to the heavens for confirmation of what he had said: and with that there came words and fire out of the mountain under which poor Christian stood, that made the hair of his flesh stand up. The words were thus pronounced: 'As many as are of the works of the law are under the curse; for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.' [Galatians 3:10]\n\nNow Christian looked for nothing but death, and began to cry out lamentably; even cursing the time in which he met with Mr. Worldly Wiseman; still calling himself a thousand fools for hearkening to his counsel; he also was greatly ashamed to think that this gentleman's arguments, flowing only from the flesh, should have the prevalency with him as to cause him to forsake the right way. This done, he applied himself again to Evangelist in words and sense as follow:\n\nCHR. Sir, what think you? Is there hope? May I now go back and go up to the wicket-gate? Shall I not be abandoned for this, and sent back from thence ashamed? I am sorry I have hearkened to this man's counsel. But may my sin be forgiven?\n\nEVAN. Then said Evangelist to him, Thy sin is very great, for by it thou hast committed two evils: thou hast forsaken the way that is good, to tread in forbidden paths; yet will the man at the gate receive thee, for he has goodwill for men; only, said he, take heed that thou turn not aside again, 'lest thou perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little.' [Psalm 2:12] Then did Christian address himself to go back; and Evangelist, after he had kissed him, gave him one smile, and bid him God-speed. So he went on with haste, neither spake he to any man by the way; nor, if any asked him, would he vouchsafe them an answer. He went like one that was all the while treading on forbidden ground, and could by no means think himself safe, till again he was got into the way which he left, to follow Mr. Worldly Wiseman's counsel. So, in process of time, Christian got up to the gate. Now, over the gate there was written, 'Knock, and it shall be opened unto you.' [Matthew7:8]\n\n<blockquote>\"He that will enter in must first without\nStand knocking at the Gate, nor need he doubt\nThat is A KNOCKER but to enter in;\nFor God can love him, and forgive his sin.\"</blockquote>\n\nHe knocked, therefore, more than once or twice, saying&mdash;\n\n<blockquote>\"May I now enter here? Will he within\nOpen to sorry me, though I have been\nAn undeserving rebel? Then shall I\nNot fail to sing his lasting praise on high.\"</blockquote>\n\nAt last there came a grave person to the gate, named Good-will, who asked who was there? and whence he came? and what he would have?\n\nCHR. Here is a poor burdened sinner. I come from the City of Destruction, but am going to Mount Zion, that I may be delivered from the wrath to come. I would therefore, Sir, since I am informed that by this gate is the way thither, know if you are willing to let me in?\n\nGOOD-WILL. I am willing with all my heart, said he; and with that he opened the gate.\n\nSo when Christian was stepping in, the other gave him a pull. Then said Christian, What means that? The other told him. A little distance from this gate, there is erected a strong castle, of which Beelzebub is the captain; from thence, both he and them that are with him shoot arrows at those that come up to this gate, if haply they may die before they can enter in.\n\nThen said Christian, I rejoice and tremble. So when he was got in, the man of the gate asked him who directed him thither?\n\nCHR. Evangelist bid me come hither, and knock, (as I did); and he said that you, Sir, would tell me what I must do.\n\nGOOD-WILL. An open door is set before thee, and no man can shut it.\n\nCHR. Now I begin to reap the benefits of my hazards.\n\nGOOD-WILL. But how is it that you came alone?\n\nCHR. Because none of my neighbours saw their danger, as I saw mine.\n\nGOOD-WILL. Did any of them know of your coming?\n\nCHR. Yes; my wife and children saw me at the first, and called after me to turn again; also, some of my neighbours stood crying and calling after me to return; but I put my fingers in my ears, and so came on my way.\n\nGOOD-WILL. But did none of them follow you, to persuade you to go back?\n\nCHR. Yes, both Obstinate and Pliable; but when they saw that they could not prevail, Obstinate went railing back, but Pliable came with me a little way.\n\nGOOD-WILL. But why did he not come through?\n\nCHR. We, indeed, came both together, until we came at the Slough of Despond, into the which we also suddenly fell. And then was my neighbour, Pliable, discouraged, and would not venture further. Wherefore, getting out again on that side next to his own house, he told me I should possess the brave country alone for him; so he went his way, and I came mine--he after Obstinate, and I to this gate.\n\nGOOD-WILL. Then said Good-will, Alas, poor man! is the celestial glory of so small esteem with him, that he counteth it not worth running the hazards of a few difficulties to obtain it?\n\nCHR. Truly, said Christian, I have said the truth of Pliable, and if I should also say all the truth of myself, it will appear there is no betterment betwixt him and myself. It is true, he went back to his own house, but I also turned aside to go in the way of death, being persuaded thereto by the carnal arguments of one Mr. Worldly Wiseman.\n\nGOOD-WILL. Oh, did he light upon you? What! he would have had you a sought for ease at the hands of Mr. Legality. They are, both of them, a very cheat. But did you take his counsel?\n\nCHR. Yes, as far as I durst; I went to find out Mr. Legality, until I thought that the mountain that stands by his house would have fallen upon my head; wherefore there I was forced to stop.\n\nGOOD-WILL. That mountain has been the death of many, and will be the death of many more; it is well you escaped being by it dashed in pieces.\n\nCHR. Why, truly, I do not know what had become of me there, had not Evangelist happily met me again, as I was musing in the midst of my dumps; but it was God's mercy that he came to me again, for else I had never come hither. But now I am come, such a one as I am, more fit, indeed, for death, by that mountain, than thus to stand talking with my lord; but, oh, what a favour is this to me, that yet I am admitted entrance here!\n\nGOOD-WILL. We make no objections against any, notwithstanding all that they have done before they came hither. They are in no wise cast out [John 6:37]; and therefore, good Christian, come a little way with me, and I will teach thee about the way thou must go. Look before thee; dost thou see this narrow way? THAT is the way thou must go; it was cast up by the patriarchs, prophets, Christ, and his apostles; and it is as straight as a rule can make it. This is the way thou must go.\n\nCHR. But, said Christian, are there no turnings or windings by which a stranger may lose his way?\n\nGOOD-WILL. Yes, there are many ways butt down upon this, and they are crooked and wide. But thus thou mayest distinguish the right from the wrong, the right only being straight and narrow. [Matthew 7:14]\n\nThen I saw in my dream that Christian asked him further if he could not help him off with his burden that was upon his back; for as yet he had not got rid thereof, nor could he by any means get it off without help.\n\nHe told him, As to thy burden, be content to bear it, until thou comest to the place of deliverance; for there it will fall from thy back of itself.\n\nThen Christian began to gird up his loins, and to address himself to his journey. So the other told him, That by that he was gone some distance from the gate, he would come at the house of the Interpreter, at whose door he should knock, and he would show him excellent things. Then Christian took his leave of his friend, and he again bid him God-speed.\n\nThen he went on till he came to the house of the Interpreter, where he knocked over and over; at last one came to the door, and asked who was there.\n\nCHR. Sir, here is a traveller, who was bid by an acquaintance of the good-man of this house to call here for my profit; I would therefore speak with the master of the house. So he called for the master of the house, who, after a little time, came to Christian, and asked him what he would have.\n\nCHR. Sir, said Christian, I am a man that am come from the City of Destruction, and am going to the Mount Zion; and I was told by the man that stands at the gate, at the head of this way, that if I called here, you would show me excellent things, such as would be a help to me in my journey.\n\nINTER. Then said the Interpreter, Come in; I will show that which will be profitable to thee. So he commanded his man to light the candle, and bid Christian follow him: so he had him into a private room, and bid his man open a door; the which when he had done, Christian saw the picture of a very grave person hang up against the wall; and this was the fashion of it. It had eyes lifted up to heaven, the best of books in his hand, the law of truth was written upon his lips, the world was behind his back. It stood as if it pleaded with men, and a crown of gold did hang over his head.\n\nCHR. Then said Christian, What meaneth this?\n\nINTER. The man whose picture this is, is one of a thousand; he can beget children [1 Corinthians 4:15], travail in birth with children [Galatians 4:19], and nurse them himself when they are born. And whereas thou seest him with his eyes lift up to heaven, the best of books in his hand, and the law of truth writ on his lips, it is to show thee that his work is to know and unfold dark things to sinners; even as also thou seest him stand as if he pleaded with men: and whereas thou seest the world as cast behind him, and that a crown hangs over his head, that is to show thee that slighting and despising the things that are present, for the love that he hath to his Master's service, he is sure in the world that comes next to have glory for his reward. Now, said the Interpreter, I have showed thee this picture first, because the man whose picture this is, is the only man whom the Lord of the place whither thou art going, hath authorised to be thy guide in all difficult places thou mayest meet with in the way; wherefore, take good heed to what I have shewed thee, and bear well in thy mind what thou hast seen, lest in thy journey thou meet with some that pretend to lead thee right, but their way goes down to death.\n\nThen he took him by the hand, and led him into a very large parlour that was full of dust, because never swept; the which after he had reviewed a little while, the Interpreter called for a man to sweep. Now, when he began to sweep, the dust began so abundantly to fly about, that Christian had almost therewith been choked. Then said the Interpreter to a damsel that stood by, Bring hither the water, and sprinkle the room; the which, when she had done, it was swept and cleansed with pleasure.\n\nCHR. Then said Christian, What means this?\n\nINTER. The Interpreter answered, This parlour is the heart of a man that was never sanctified by the sweet grace of the gospel; the dust is his original sin and inward corruptions, that have defiled the whole man. He that began to sweep at first, is the Law; but she that brought water, and did sprinkle it, is the Gospel. Now, whereas thou sawest, that so soon as the first began to sweep, the dust did so fly about that the room by him could not be cleansed, but that thou wast almost choked therewith; this is to shew thee, that the law, instead of cleansing the heart (by its working) from sin, doth revive, put strength into, and increase it in the soul, even as it doth discover and forbid it, for it doth not give power to subdue. [Romans 7:6; 1 Corinthians 15:56; Romans 5:20]\n\nAgain, as thou sawest the damsel sprinkle the room with water, upon which it was cleansed with pleasure; this is to show thee, that when the gospel comes in the sweet and precious influences thereof to the heart, then, I say, even as thou sawest the damsel lay the dust by sprinkling the floor with water, so is sin vanquished and subdued, and the soul made clean through the faith of it, and consequently fit for the King of glory to inhabit. [John 15:3; Ephesians 5:26; Acts 15:9; Romans 16:25,26; John 15:13]\n\nI saw, moreover, in my dream, that the Interpreter took him by the hand, and had him into a little room, where sat two little children, each one in his chair. The name of the eldest was Passion, and the name of the other Patience. Passion seemed to be much discontented; but Patience was very quiet. Then Christian asked, What is the reason of the discontent of Passion? The Interpreter answered, The Governor of them would have him stay for his best things till the beginning of the next year; but he will have all now: but Patience is willing to wait.\n\nThen I saw that one came to Passion, and brought him a bag of treasure, and poured it down at his feet, the which he took up and rejoiced therein, and withal laughed Patience to scorn. But I beheld but a while, and he had lavished all away, and had nothing left him but rags.\n\nCHR. Then said Christian to the Interpreter, Expound this matter more fully to me.\n\nINTER. So he said, These two lads are figures: Passion, of the men of this world; and Patience, of the men of that which is to come; for as here thou seest, Passion will have all now this year, that is to say, in this world; so are the men of this world, they must have all their good things now, they cannot stay till next year, that is until the next world, for their portion of good. That proverb, 'A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush', is of more authority with them than are all the Divine testimonies of the good of the world to come. But as thou sawest that he had quickly lavished all away, and had presently left him nothing but rags; so will it be with all such men at the end of this world.\n\nCHR. Then said Christian, Now I see that Patience has the best wisdom, and that upon many accounts. First, because he stays for the best things. Second, and also because he will have the glory of his, when the other has nothing but rags.\n\nINTER. Nay, you may add another, to wit, the glory of the next world will never wear out; but these are suddenly gone. Therefore Passion had not so much reason to laugh at Patience, because he had his good things first, as Patience will have to laugh at Passion, because he had his best things last; for first must give place to last, because last must have his time to come; but last gives place to nothing; for there is not another to succeed. He, therefore, that hath his portion first, must needs have a time to spend it; but he that hath his portion last, must have it lastingly; therefore it is said of Dives, \"Thou in thy life-time receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things; but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.\" [Luke 16:25]\n\nCHR. Then I perceive it is not best to covet things that are now, but to wait for things to come.\n\nINTER. You say the truth: \"For the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.\" [2 Corinthians 4:18] But though this be so, yet since things present and our fleshly appetite are such near neighbours one to another; and again, because things to come, and carnal sense, are such strangers one to another; therefore it is, that the first of these so suddenly fall into amity, and that distance is so continued between the second.\n\nThen I saw in my dream that the Interpreter took Christian by the hand, and led him into a place where was a fire burning against a wall, and one standing by it, always casting much water upon it, to quench it; yet did the fire burn higher and hotter.\n\nThen said Christian, What means this?\n\nThe Interpreter answered, This fire is the work of grace that is wrought in the heart; he that casts water upon it, to extinguish and put it out, is the Devil; but in that thou seest the fire notwithstanding burn higher and hotter, thou shalt also see the reason of that. So he had him about to the backside of the wall, where he saw a man with a vessel of oil in his hand, of the which he did also continually cast, but secretly, into the fire.\n\nThen said Christian, What means this?\n\nThe Interpreter answered, This is Christ, who continually, with the oil of his grace, maintains the work already begun in the heart: by the means of which, notwithstanding what the devil can do, the souls of his people prove gracious still. [2 Corinthians 12:9] And in that thou sawest that the man stood behind the wall to maintain the fire, that is to teach thee that it is hard for the tempted to see how this work of grace is maintained in the soul.\n\nI saw also, that the Interpreter took him again by the hand, and led him into a pleasant place, where was builded a stately palace, beautiful to behold; at the sight of which Christian was greatly delighted. He saw also, upon the top thereof, certain persons walking, who were clothed all in gold.\n\nThen said Christian, May we go in thither?\n\nThen the Interpreter took him, and led him up towards the door of the palace; and behold, at the door stood a great company of men, as desirous to go in; but durst not. There also sat a man at a little distance from the door, at a table-side, with a book and his inkhorn before him, to take the name of him that should enter therein; he saw also, that in the doorway stood many men in armour to keep it, being resolved to do the men that would enter what hurt and mischief they could. Now was Christian somewhat in amaze. At last, when every man started back for fear of the armed men, Christian saw a man of a very stout countenance come up to the man that sat there to write, saying, Set down my name, Sir: the which when he had done, he saw the man draw his sword, and put a helmet upon his head, and rush toward the door upon the armed men, who laid upon him with deadly force; but the man, not at all discouraged, fell to cutting and hacking most fiercely. So after he had received and given many wounds to those that attempted to keep him out, he cut his way through them all [Acts 14:22], and pressed forward into the palace, at which there was a pleasant voice heard from those that were within, even of those that walked upon the top of the palace, saying--\n\n\"Come in, come in; Eternal glory thou shalt win.\"\n\nSo he went in, and was clothed with such garments as they. Then Christian smiled and said; I think verily I know the meaning of this.\n\nNow, said Christian, let me go hence. Nay, stay, said the Interpreter, till I have shewed thee a little more, and after that thou shalt go on thy way. So he took him by the hand again, and led him into a very dark room, where there sat a man in an iron cage.\n\nNow the man, to look on, seemed very sad; he sat with his eyes looking down to the ground, his hands folded together, and he sighed as if he would break his heart. Then said Christian, What means this? At which the Interpreter bid him talk with the man.\n\nThen said Christian to the man, What art thou? The man answered, I am what I was not once.\n\nCHR. What wast thou once?\n\nMAN. The man said, I was once a fair and flourishing professor, both in mine own eyes, and also in the eyes of others; I once was, as I thought, fair for the Celestial City, and had then even joy at the thoughts that I should get thither. [Luke 8:13]\n\nCHR. Well, but what art thou now?\n\nMAN. I am now a man of despair, and am shut up in it, as in this iron cage. I cannot get out. Oh, now I cannot!\n\nCHR. But how camest thou in this condition?\n\nMAN. I left off to watch and be sober. I laid the reins, upon the neck of my lusts; I sinned against the light of the Word and the goodness of God; I have grieved the Spirit, and he is gone; I tempted the devil, and he is come to me; I have provoked God to anger, and he has left me: I have so hardened my heart, that I cannot repent.\n\nThen said Christian to the Interpreter, But is there no hope for such a man as this? Ask him, said the Interpreter. Nay, said Christian, pray, Sir, do you.\n\nINTER. Then said the Interpreter, Is there no hope, but you must be kept in the iron cage of despair?\n\nMAN. No, none at all.\n\nINTER. Why, the Son of the Blessed is very pitiful.\n\nMAN. I have crucified him to myself afresh [Hebrews 6:6]; I have despised his person [Luke 19:14]; I have despised his righteousness; I have \"counted his blood an unholy thing\"; I have \"done despite to the Spirit of grace\". [Hebrews 10:28-29] Therefore I have shut myself out of all the promises, and there now remains to me nothing but threatenings, dreadful threatenings, fearful threatenings, of certain judgement and fiery indignation, which shall devour me as an adversary.\n\nINTER. For what did you bring yourself into this condition?\n\nMAN. For the lusts, pleasures, and profits of this world; in the enjoyment of which I did then promise myself much delight; but now every one of those things also bite me, and gnaw me like a burning worm.\n\nINTER. But canst thou not now repent and turn?\n\nMAN. God hath denied me repentance. His Word gives me no encouragement to believe; yea, himself hath shut me up in this iron cage; nor can all the men in the world let me out. O eternity, eternity! how shall I grapple with the misery that I must meet with in eternity!\n\nINTER. Then said the Interpreter to Christian, Let this man's misery be remembered by thee, and be an everlasting caution to thee.\n\nCHR. Well, said Christian, this is fearful! God help me to watch and be sober, and to pray that I may shun the cause of this man's misery! Sir, is it not time for me to go on my way now?\n\nINTER. Tarry till I shall show thee one thing more, and then thou shalt go on thy way.\n\nSo he took Christian by the hand again, and led him into a chamber, where there was one rising out of bed; and as he put on his raiment, he shook and trembled. Then said Christian, Why doth this man thus tremble? The Interpreter then bid him tell to Christian the reason of his so doing. So he began and said, This night, as I was in my sleep, I dreamed, and behold the heavens grew exceeding black; also it thundered and lightened in most fearful wise, that it put me into an agony; so I looked up in my dream, and saw the clouds rack at an unusual rate, upon which I heard a great sound of a trumpet, and saw also a man sit upon a cloud, attended with the thousands of heaven; they were all in flaming fire: also the heavens were in a burning flame. I heard then a voice saying, \"Arise, ye dead, and come to judgement\"; and with that the rocks rent, the graves opened, and the dead that were therein came forth. Some of them were exceeding glad, and looked upward; and some sought to hide themselves under the mountains. [1 Corinthians 15:52; 1 Thessalonians 4:16; Jude 14; John 5:28,29; 2 Thessalonians 1:7,8; Revelation 20:11-14; Isaiah 26:21; Micah 7:16,17; Psalm 95:1-3; Daniel 7:10] Then I saw the man that sat upon the cloud open the book, and bid the world draw near. Yet there was, by reason of a fierce flame which issued out and came from before him, a convenient distance betwixt him and them, as betwixt the judge and the prisoners at the bar. [Malachi 3:2,3; Daniel 7:9,10] I heard it also proclaimed to them that attended on the man that sat on the cloud, Gather together the tares, the chaff, and stubble, and cast them into the burning lake. [Matthew 3:12; 13:30; Malachi 4:1] And with that, the bottomless pit opened, just whereabout I stood; out of the mouth of which there came, in an abundant manner, smoke and coals of fire, with hideous noises. It was also said to the same persons, \"Gather my wheat into the garner.\" [Luke 3:17] And with that I saw many catched up and carried away into the clouds, but I was left behind. [1 Thessalonians 4:16,17] I also sought to hide myself, but I could not, for the man that sat upon the cloud still kept his eye upon me; my sins also came into my mind; and my conscience did accuse me on every side. [Romans 3:14,15] Upon this I awaked from my sleep.\n\nCHR. But what is it that made you so afraid of this sight?\n\nMAN. Why, I thought that the day of judgement was come, and that I was not ready for it: but this frighted me most, that the angels gathered up several, and left me behind; also the pit of hell opened her mouth just where I stood. My conscience, too, afflicted me; and, as I thought, the Judge had always his eye upon me, shewing indignation in his countenance.\n\nThen said the Interpreter to Christian, Hast thou considered all these things?\n\nCHR. Yes, and they put me in hope and fear.\n\nINTER. Well, keep all things so in thy mind that they may be as a goad in thy sides, to prick thee forward in the way thou must go. Then Christian began to gird up his loins, and to address himself to his journey. Then said the Interpreter, The Comforter be always with thee, good Christian, to guide thee in the way that leads to the City. So Christian went on his way, saying&mdash;\n\n\"Here I have seen things rare and profitable; Things pleasant, dreadful, things to make me stable In what I have begun to take in hand; Then let me think on them, and understand Wherefore they showed me were, and let me be Thankful, O good Interpreter, to thee.\"\n\nNow I saw in my dream, that the highway up which Christian was to go, was fenced on either side with a wall, and that wall was called Salvation. [Isaiah 26:1] Up this way, therefore, did burdened Christian run, but not without great difficulty, because of the load on his back.\n\nHe ran thus till he came at a place somewhat ascending, and upon that place stood a cross, and a little below, in the bottom, a sepulchre. So I saw in my dream, that just as Christian came up with the cross, his burden loosed from off his shoulders, and fell from off his back, and began to tumble, and so continued to do, till it came to the mouth of the sepulchre, where it fell in, and I saw it no more.\n\nThen was Christian glad and lightsome, and said, with a merry heart, \"He hath given me rest by his sorrow, and life by his death.\" Then he stood still awhile to look and wonder; for it was very surprising to him, that the sight of the cross should thus ease him of his burden. He looked therefore, and looked again, even till the springs that were in his head sent the waters down his cheeks. [Zechariah 12:10] Now, as he stood looking and weeping, behold three Shining Ones came to him and saluted him with \"Peace be unto thee\". So the first said to him, \"Thy sins be forgiven thee\" [Mark 2:5]; the second stripped him of his rags, and clothed him with change of raiment [Zechariah 3:4]; the third also set a mark on his forehead, and gave him a roll with a seal upon it, which he bade him look on as he ran, and that he should give it in at the Celestial Gate. [Ephesians 1:13] So they went their way.\n\n\"Who's this? the Pilgrim. How! 'tis very true, Old things are past away, all's become new. Strange! he's another man, upon my word, They be fine feathers that make a fine bird.\n\nThen Christian gave three leaps for joy, and went on singing--\n\n<blockquote>\"Thus far I did come laden with my sin;\nNor could aught ease the grief that I was in\nTill I came hither: What a place is this!\nMust here be the beginning of my bliss?\nMust here the burden fall from off my back?\nMust here the strings that bound it to me crack?\nBlest cross! blest sepulchre! blest rather be\nThe Man that there was put to shame for me!\"</blockquote>\n\nI saw then in my dream, that he went on thus, even until he came at a bottom, where he saw, a little out of the way, three men fast asleep, with fetters upon their heels. The name of the one was Simple, another Sloth, and the third Presumption.\n\nChristian then seeing them lie in this case went to them, if peradventure he might awake them, and cried, You are like them that sleep on the top of a mast, for the Dead Sea is under you&mdash;a gulf that hath no bottom. [Proverbs 23:34] Awake, therefore, and come away; be willing also, and I will help you off with your irons. He also told them, If he that \"goeth about like a roaring lion\" comes by, you will certainly become a prey to his teeth. [1 Peter 5:8] With that they looked upon him, and began to reply in this sort: Simple said, \"I see no danger\"; Sloth said, \"Yet a little more sleep\"; and Presumption said, \"Every fat must stand upon its own bottom; what is the answer else that I should give thee?\" And so they lay down to sleep again, and Christian went on his way.\n\nYet was he troubled to think that men in that danger should so little esteem the kindness of him that so freely offered to help them, both by awakening of them, counselling of them, and proffering to help them off with their irons. And as he was troubled thereabout, he espied two men come tumbling over the wall on the left hand of the narrow way; and they made up apace to him. The name of the one was Formalist, and the name of the other Hypocrisy. So, as I said, they drew up unto him, who thus entered with them into discourse.\n\nCHR. Gentlemen, whence came you, and whither go you?\n\nFORM. and HYP. We were born in the land of Vain-glory, and are going for praise to Mount Zion.\n\nCHR. Why came you not in at the gate which standeth at the beginning of the way? Know you not that it is written, that he that cometh not in by the door, \"but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber?\" [John 10:1]\n\nFORM. and HYP. They said, That to go to the gate for entrance was, by all their countrymen, counted too far about; and that, therefore, their usual way was to make a short cut of it, and to climb over the wall, as they had done.\n\nCHR. But will it not be counted a trespass against the Lord of the city whither we are bound, thus to violate his revealed will?\n\nFORM. and HYP. They told him, that, as for that, he needed not to trouble his head thereabout; for what they did they had custom for; and could produce, if need were, testimony that would witness it for more than a thousand years.\n\nCHR. But, said Christian, will your practice stand a trial at law?\n\nFORM. and HYP. They told him, That custom, it being of so long a standing as above a thousand years, would, doubtless, now be admitted as a thing legal by any impartial judge; and besides, said they, if we get into the way, what's matter which way we get in? if we are in, we are in; thou art but in the way, who, as we perceive, came in at the gate; and we are also in the way, that came tumbling over the wall; wherein, now, is thy condition better than ours?\n\nCHR. I walk by the rule of my Master; you walk by the rude working of your fancies. You are counted thieves already, by the Lord of the way; therefore, I doubt you will not be found true men at the end of the way. You come in by yourselves, without his direction; and shall go out by yourselves, without his mercy.\n\nTo this they made him but little answer; only they bid him look to himself. Then I saw that they went on every man in his way without much conference one with another, save that these two men told Christian, that as to laws and ordinances, they doubted not but they should as conscientiously do them as he; therefore, said they, we see not wherein thou differest from us but by the coat that is on thy back, which was, as we trow, given thee by some of thy neighbours, to hide the shame of thy nakedness.\n\nCHR. By laws and ordinances you will not be saved, since you came not in by the door. [Galatians 2:16] And as for this coat that is on my back, it was given me by the Lord of the place whither I go; and that, as you say, to cover my nakedness with. And I take it as a token of his kindness to me; for I had nothing but rags before. And besides, thus I comfort myself as I go: Surely, think I, when I come to the gate of the city, the Lord thereof will know me for good since I have this coat on my back--a coat that he gave me freely in the day that he stripped me of my rags. I have, moreover, a mark in my forehead, of which, perhaps, you have taken no notice, which one of my Lord's most intimate associates fixed there in the day that my burden fell off my shoulders. I will tell you, moreover, that I had then given me a roll, sealed, to comfort me by reading as I go on the way; I was also bid to give it in at the Celestial Gate, in token of my certain going in after it; all which things, I doubt, you want, and want them because you came not in at the gate.\n\nTo these things they gave him no answer; only they looked upon each other, and laughed. Then, I saw that they went on all, save that Christian kept before, who had no more talk but with himself, and that sometimes sighingly, and sometimes comfortably; also he would be often reading in the roll that one of the Shining Ones gave him, by which he was refreshed.\n\nI beheld, then, that they all went on till they came to the foot of the Hill Difficulty; at the bottom of which was a spring. There were also in the same place two other ways besides that which came straight from the gate; one turned to the left hand, and the other to the right, at the bottom of the hill; but the narrow way lay right up the hill, and the name of the going up the side of the hill is called Difficulty. Christian now went to the spring, and drank thereof, to refresh himself [Isaiah 49:10], and then began to go up the hill, saying&mdash;\n\n<blockquote>\"The hill, though high, I covet to ascend,\nThe difficulty will not me offend;\nFor I perceive the way to life lies here.\nCome, pluck up heart, let's neither faint nor fear;\nBetter, though difficult, the right way to go,\nThan wrong, though easy, where the end is woe.\"</blockquote>\n\nThe other two also came to the foot of the hill; but when they saw that the hill was steep and high, and that there were two other ways to go, and supposing also that these two ways might meet again, with that up which Christian went, on the other side of the hill, therefore they were resolved to go in those ways. Now the name of one of these ways was Danger, and the name of the other Destruction. So the one took the way which is called Danger, which led him into a great wood, and the other took directly up the way to Destruction, which led him into a wide field, full of dark mountains, where he stumbled and fell, and rose no more.\n\n\"Shall they who wrong begin yet rightly end? Shall they at all have safety for their friend? No, no; in headstrong manner they set out, And headlong will they fall at last no doubt.\"\n\nI looked, then, after Christian, to see him go up the hill, where I perceived he fell from running to going, and from going to clambering upon his hands and his knees, because of the steepness of the place. Now, about the midway to the top of the hill was a pleasant arbour, made by the Lord of the hill for the refreshing of weary travellers; thither, therefore, Christian got, where also he sat down to rest him. Then he pulled his roll out of his bosom, and read therein to his comfort; he also now began afresh to take a review of the coat or garment that was given him as he stood by the cross. Thus pleasing himself awhile, he at last fell into a slumber, and thence into a fast sleep, which detained him in that place until it was almost night; and in his sleep, his roll fell out of his hand. Now, as he was sleeping, there came one to him, and awaked him, saying, Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways and be wise. [Proverbs 6:6] And with that Christian started up, and sped him on his way, and went apace, till he came to the top of the hill.\n\nNow, when he was got up to the top of the hill, there came two men running to meet him amain; the name of the one was Timorous, and of the other, Mistrust; to whom Christian said, Sirs, what's the matter? You run the wrong way. Timorous answered, that they were going to the City of Zion, and had got up that difficult place; but, said he, the further we go, the more danger we meet with; wherefore we turned, and are going back again.\n\nYes, said Mistrust, for just before us lie a couple of lions in the way, whether sleeping or waking we know not, and we could not think, if we came within reach, but they would presently pull us in pieces.\n\nCHR. Then said Christian, You make me afraid, but whither shall I fly to be safe? If I go back to mine own country, that is prepared for fire and brimstone, and I shall certainly perish there. If I can get to the Celestial City, I am sure to be in safety there. I must venture. To go back is nothing but death; to go forward is fear of death, and life-everlasting beyond it. I will yet go forward. So Mistrust and Timorous ran down the hill, and Christian went on his way. But, thinking again of what he had heard from the men, he felt in his bosom for his roll, that he might read therein, and be comforted; but he felt, and found it not. Then was Christian in great distress, and knew not what to do; for he wanted that which used to relieve him, and that which should have been his pass into the Celestial City. Here, therefore, he begun to be much perplexed, and knew not what to do. At last he bethought himself that he had slept in the arbour that is on the side of the hill; and, falling down upon his knees, he asked God's forgiveness for that his foolish act, and then went back to look for his roll. But all the way he went back, who can sufficiently set forth the sorrow of Christian's heart? Sometimes he sighed, sometimes he wept, and oftentimes he chid himself for being so foolish to fall asleep in that place, which was erected only for a little refreshment for his weariness. Thus, therefore, he went back, carefully looking on this side and on that, all the way as he went, if happily he might find his roll, that had been his comfort so many times in his journey. He went thus, till he came again within sight of the arbour where he sat and slept; but that sight renewed his sorrow the more, by bringing again, even afresh, his evil of sleeping into his mind. [Revelation 2:5; 1 Thessalonians 5:7,8] Thus, therefore, he now went on bewailing his sinful sleep, saying, O wretched man that I am that I should sleep in the day-time! that I should sleep in the midst of difficulty! that I should so indulge the flesh, as to use that rest for ease to my flesh, which the Lord of the hill hath erected only for the relief of the spirits of pilgrims!\n\nHow many steps have I took in vain! Thus it happened to Israel, for their sin; they were sent back again by the way of the Red Sea; and I am made to tread those steps with sorrow, which I might have trod with delight, had it not been for this sinful sleep. How far might I have been on my way by this time! I am made to tread those steps thrice over, which I needed not to have trod but once; yea, now also I am like to be benighted, for the day is almost spent. O, that I had not slept!\n\nNow, by this time he was come to the arbour again, where for a while he sat down and wept; but at last, as Christian would have it, looking sorrowfully down under the settle, there he espied his roll; the which he, with trembling and haste, catched up, and put it into his bosom. But who can tell how joyful this man was when he had gotten his roll again! for this roll was the assurance of his life and acceptance at the desired haven. Therefore he laid it up in his bosom, gave thanks to God for directing his eye to the place where it lay, and with joy and tears betook himself again to his journey. But oh, how nimbly now did he go up the rest of the hill! Yet, before he got up, the sun went down upon Christian; and this made him again recall the vanity of his sleeping to his remembrance; and thus he again began to condole with himself: O thou sinful sleep; how, for thy sake, am I like to be benighted in my journey! I must walk without the sun; darkness must cover the path of my feet; and I must hear the noise of the doleful creatures, because of my sinful sleep. [1 Thessalonians 5:6,7] Now also he remembered the story that Mistrust and Timorous told him of; how they were frighted with the sight of the lions. Then said Christian to himself again, These beasts range in the night for their prey; and if they should meet with me in the dark, how should I shift them? How should I escape being by them torn in pieces? Thus he went on his way. But while he was thus bewailing his unhappy miscarriage, he lift up his eyes, and behold there was a very stately palace before him, the name of which was Beautiful; and it stood just by the highway side.\n\nSo I saw in my dream that he made haste and went forward, that if possible he might get lodging there. Now, before he had gone far, he entered into a very narrow passage, which was about a furlong off the porter's lodge; and looking very narrowly before him as he went, he espied two lions in the way. Now, thought he, I see the dangers that Mistrust and Timorous were driven back by. (The lions were chained, but he saw not the chains.) Then he was afraid, and thought also himself to go back after them, for he thought nothing but death was before him. But the porter at the lodge, whose name is Watchful, perceiving that Christian made a halt as if he would go back, cried unto him, saying, Is thy strength so small? [Mark 8:34-37] Fear not the lions, for they are chained, and are placed there for trial of faith where it is, and for discovery of those that had none. Keep in the midst of the path, no hurt shall come unto thee.\n\n<blockquote>\"Difficulty is behind, Fear is before,\nThough he's got on the hill, the lions roar;\nA Christian man is never long at ease,\nWhen one fright's gone, another doth him seize.\"</blockquote>\n\nThen I saw that he went on, trembling for fear of the lions, but taking good heed to the directions of the porter; he heard them roar, but they did him no harm. Then he clapped his hands, and went on till he came and stood before the gate where the porter was. Then said Christian to the porter, Sir, what house is this? And may I lodge here to-night? The porter answered, This house was built by the Lord of the hill, and he built it for the relief and security of pilgrims. The porter also asked whence he was, and whither he was going.\n\nCHR. I am come from the City of Destruction, and am going to Mount Zion; but because the sun is now set, I desire, if I may, to lodge here to-night.\n\nPOR. What is your name?\n\nCHR. My name is now Christian, but my name at the first was Graceless; I came of the race of Japheth, whom God will persuade to dwell in the tents of Shem. [Genesis 9:27]\n\nPOR. But how doth it happen that you come so late? The sun is set.\n\nCHR. I had been here sooner, but that, \"wretched man that I am!\" I slept in the arbour that stands on the hillside; nay, I had, notwithstanding that, been here much sooner, but that, in my sleep, I lost my evidence, and came without it to the brow of the hill and then feeling for it, and finding it not, I was forced with sorrow of heart, to go back to the place where I slept my sleep, where I found it, and now I am come.\n\nPOR. Well, I will call out one of the virgins of this place, who will, if she likes your talk, bring you into the rest of the family, according to the rules of the house. So Watchful, the porter, rang a bell, at the sound of which came out at the door of the house, a grave and beautiful damsel, named Discretion, and asked why she was called.\n\nThe porter answered, This man is in a journey from the City of Destruction to Mount Zion, but being weary and benighted, he asked me if he might lodge here to-night; so I told him I would call for thee, who, after discourse had with him, mayest do as seemeth thee good, even according to the law of the house.\n\nThen she asked him whence he was, and whither he was going, and he told her. She asked him also how he got into the way; and he told her. Then she asked him what he had seen and met with in the way; and he told, her. And last she asked his name; so he said, It is Christian, and I have so much the more a desire to lodge here to-night, because, by what I perceive, this place was built by the Lord of the hill for the relief and security of pilgrims. So she smiled, but the water stood in her eyes; and after a little pause, she said, I will call forth two or three more of the family. So she ran to the door, and called out Prudence, Piety, and Charity, who, after a little more discourse with him, had him into the family; and many of them, meeting him at the threshold of the house, said, Come in, thou blessed of the Lord; this house was built by the Lord of the hill, on purpose to entertain such pilgrims in. Then he bowed his head, and followed them into the house. So when he was come in and sat down, they gave him something to drink, and consented together, that until supper was ready, some of them should have some particular discourse with Christian, for the best improvement of time; and they appointed Piety, and Prudence, and Charity to discourse with him; and thus they began:\n\nPIETY. Come, good Christian, since we have been so loving to you, to receive you in our house this night, let us, if perhaps we may better ourselves thereby, talk with you of all things that have happened to you in your pilgrimage.\n\nCHR. With a very good will, and I am glad that you are so well disposed.\n\nPIETY. What moved you at first to betake yourself to a pilgrim's life?\n\nCHR. I was driven out of my native country by a dreadful sound that was in mine ears: to wit, that unavoidable destruction did attend me, if I abode in that place where I was.\n\nPIETY. But how did it happen that you came out of your country this way?\n\nCHR. It was as God would have it; for when I was under the fears of destruction, I did not know whither to go; but by chance there came a man, even to me, as I was trembling and weeping, whose name is Evangelist, and he directed me to the wicket-gate, which else I should never have found, and so set me into the way that hath led me directly to this house.\n\nPIETY. But did you not come by the house of the Interpreter?\n\nCHR. Yes, and did see such things there, the remembrance of which will stick by me as long as I live; especially three things: to wit, how Christ, in despite of Satan, maintains his work of grace in the heart; how the man had sinned himself quite out of hopes of God's mercy; and also the dream of him that thought in his sleep the day of judgement was come.\n\nPIETY. Why, did you hear him tell his dream?\n\nCHR. Yes, and a dreadful one it was. I thought it made my heart ache as he was telling of it; but yet I am glad I heard it.\n\nPIETY. Was that all that you saw at the house of the Interpreter?\n\nCHR. No; he took me and had me where he shewed me a stately palace, and how the people were clad in gold that were in it; and how there came a venturous man and cut his way through the armed men that stood in the door to keep him out, and how he was bid to come in, and win eternal glory. Methought those things did ravish my heart! I would have stayed at that good man's house a twelvemonth, but that I knew I had further to go.\n\nPIETY. And what saw you else in the way?\n\nCHR. Saw! why, I went but a little further, and I saw one, as I thought in my mind, hang bleeding upon the tree; and the very sight of him made my burden fall off my back, (for I groaned under a very heavy burden,) but then it fell down from off me. It was a strange thing to me, for I never saw such a thing before; yea, and while I stood looking up, for then I could not forbear looking, three Shining Ones came to me. One of them testified that my sins were forgiven me; another stripped me of my rags, and gave me this broidered coat which you see; and the third set the mark which you see in my forehead, and gave me this sealed roll. (And with that he plucked it out of his bosom.)\n\nPIETY. But you saw more than this, did you not?\n\nCHR. The things that I have told you were the best; yet some other matters I saw, as, namely--I saw three men, Simple, Sloth, and Presumption, lie asleep a little out of the way, as I came, with irons upon their heels; but do you think I could awake them? I also saw Formality and Hypocrisy come tumbling over the wall, to go, as they pretended, to Zion, but they were quickly lost, even as I myself did tell them; but they would not believe. But above all, I found it hard work to get up this hill, and as hard to come by the lions' mouths, and truly if it had not been for the good man, the porter that stands at the gate, I do not know but that after all I might have gone back again; but now I thank God I am here, and I thank you for receiving of me."
