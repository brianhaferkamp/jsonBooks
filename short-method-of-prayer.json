			"chaptertext": "I did not write this little work with the thought of its being given to the public. It was prepared for the help of a few Christians who were desirous of loving God with the whole heart. But so many have requested copies of it, because of the benefit they have derived from its perusal, that I have been asked to publish it.\n\nI have left it in its natural simplicity. I do not condemn the opinions of any: on the contrary, I esteem those which are held by others, and submit all that I have written to the censure of persons of experience and learning. I only ask of all that they will not be content with examining the outside, but that they will penetrate the design of the xiiwriter, which is only to lead others to love God, and to serve Him with greater happiness and success, by enabling them to do it in a simple and easy way, fit for the little ones who are not capable of extraordinary things, but who truly desire to give *themselves to God.*\n\nI ask all who may read it, to read without prejudice; and they will discover, under common expressions, a hidden unction, which will lead them to seek for a happiness which all ought to expect to possess.\n\nI use the word *facility*, saying that perfection is easy, because it is easy to find God, *when we seek Him within ourselves*. The passage may be quoted which says, “Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me” (John vii. 34). Yet this need not occasion any difficulty; because the same God, who cannot contradict Himself, has said, “He that seeketh findeth” (Matt. vii. 8). *He who seeks God, and who yet is unwilling to forsake sin, will not find Him, because he is seeking Him where He cannot be found*; therefore it is added, “Ye shall die in your sins.” *But he who sincerely desires to forsake xiiisin, that he may draw near to God, will find Him infallibly*.\n\nMany people imagine religion so frightful, and prayer so extraordinary, that they are not willing to strive after them, never expecting to attain to them. But as the difficulty which we see in a thing causes us to despair of succeeding in it, and at the same time removes the desire to undertake it; and as, when a thing appears both desirable and easy to be attained, we give ourselves to it with pleasure, and pursue it boldly; I have been constrained to set forth the advantage and the *facility* of this way.\n\nOh! if we were persuaded of the goodness of God toward His poor creatures, and of the desire which He has to communicate Himself to them, we should not imagine so many obstacles, and despair so easily of obtaining a good which He is so infinitely desirous of imparting to us.\n\nAnd if He has not spared His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, is there anything He can refuse us? Assuredly not. We only need a little courage and perseverance. We have so much xivof both for trifling temporal interests, and we have none for the “*one thing needful*.”\n\nAs for those who find a difficulty in believing that it is easy to find God in this way, let them not believe all that they are told, but rather let them make trial of it, that they may judge for themselves; and they will find that I say very little in comparison with that which is.\n\nDear reader, study this little work with a simple and sincere heart, with lowliness of mind, without wishing to criticise it, and you will find it of good to you. Receive it with the same spirit as that in which it is given, which is no other than the longing that you may be led to *give yourself unreservedly to God*. My desire is that it may be the means of leading the simple ones and the children to their Father, who loves their humble confidence, and to whom distrust is so displeasing. Seek nothing but *the love of God*; have a sincere desire for your salvation, and you will assuredly find it, following this little unmethodical method.\n\nI do not pretend to elevate my sentiments above those of others, but I relate simply what has been xvmy own experience as well as that of others, and the advantage which I have found in this simple and natural manner of going to God.\n\nIf this book treats of nothing else but the *short and easy method of prayer*, it is because, being written only for that, it cannot speak of other things. It is certain that, if it be read in the spirit in which it has been written, there will be found nothing in it to shock the mind. Those who will make the experience of it will be the most certain of the truth which it contains.\n\nIt is to Thee, O Holy Child Jesus, who lovest simplicity and innocence, and who findest Thy delight in the children of men, that is to say, with those amongst men who are willing to become children;—it is to Thee, I say, to give worth and value to this little work, impressing it on the heart, and leading those who read it to seek Thee within themselves, where Thou wilt take Thy rest, receiving the tokens of their love, and giving them proofs of Thine.\n\nIt is Thy work, O Divine Child! O uncreated Love! O silent Word! to make Thyself beloved, xvitasted, and heard. Thou art able to do it; and I even dare to say that Thou wilt do it, by means of this little work, which is all to Thee, all of Thee, and all for Thee."

			"chaptertext": "ALL ARE COMMANDED TO PRAY—PRAYER THE GREAT MEANS OF SALVATION, AND POSSIBLE AT ALL TIMES BY THE MOST SIMPLE.\n\nPrayer is nothing else but the *application of the heart to God*, and the interior exercise of love. St Paul commands us to “pray without ceasing” (1 Thess. v. 17). Our Lord says: “Take ye heed, watch and pray.” “And what I say unto you, I say unto all” (Mark xiii. 33, 37). All, then, are capable of prayer, and it is the duty of all to engage in it.\n\nBut I do not think that all are fit for meditation; and, therefore, it is not that sort of prayer which God demands or desires of them.\n\nMy dear friends, whoever you may be, who desire to be saved, come unto God in prayer. “I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich” (Rev. iii. 18). It is easily to be obtained, far more easily than you could ever imagine.\n\nCome, all ye that are athirst, and take this water of life freely (see Rev. xxii. 17). Do not amuse yourselves by hewing out to yourselves “broken cisterns that can hold no water” (Jer. ii. 13). Come, hungry souls, who find nothing that can satisfy you, and you shall be *filled*. Come, poor afflicted ones, weighed down with griefs and sorrows, and you shall be comforted. Come, sick ones, to the great Physician, and do not fear to approach Him because you are so weak and diseased: expose all your diseases to Him, and they shall be healed.\n\nCome, children, to your Father; He will receive you with open arms of love. Come, wandering and scattered sheep, to your Shepherd. Come, sinners, to your Saviour. Come, ignorant and foolish ones, who believe yourselves incapable of prayer; it is you who are the most fitted for it. Come all without exception; Jesus Christ calls you all.\n\nLet those only refuse to come who have no heart. The invitation is not for them; for we must have a heart in order to love. But who is indeed without heart? Oh, come and give that heart to God, and learn in the place of prayer how to do it! All those who long for prayer are capable of it, who have ordinary grace and the gift of the Holy Spirit, which is freely promised to all who ask it.\n\nPrayer is the key of perfection and of sovereign happiness; it is the efficacious means of getting rid of all vices and of acquiring all virtues; for the way to become perfect is to live in the presence of God. He tells us this Himself: “Walk before me, and be thou perfect” (Gen. xvii. 1). Prayer alone can bring you into His presence, and keep you there continually.\n\nWhat we need, then, is an attitude of prayer, in which we can *constantly* abide, and out of which exterior occupations cannot draw us; a prayer which can be offered alike by princes, kings, prelates, magistrates, soldiers, children, artisans, labourers, women, and the sick. This prayer is not mental, but *of the heart*.\n\nIt is not a prayer of thought alone, because the mind of man is so limited, that while it is occupied with one thing it cannot be thinking of another. But it is the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps;\">prayer of the heart</span>, which cannot be interrupted by the occupations of the mind. Nothing can interrupt the prayer of the heart but unruly affections; and when once we have tasted of the love of God, it is impossible to find our delight in anything but Himself.\n\nNothing is easier than to have God and to live upon Him. He is more truly in us than we are in ourselves. He is more anxious to give Himself to us than we are to possess Him. All that we want is to know the way to seek Him, which is so easy and so natural, that breathing itself is not more so.\n\nOh, you who imagine yourselves incapable of religious feeling, you may live in prayer and in God as easily and as continuously as you live by the air you breathe. Will you not, then, be inexcusable if you neglect to do it, after you have learned the way?"

			"chaptertext": "FIRST DEGREE OF PRAYER—MEDITATION AND MEDITATIVE READING—THE LORD’S PRAYER—PASSAGE FROM THE FIRST DEGREE TO THE SECOND.\n\nThere are two means by which we may be led into the higher forms of prayer. One is *Meditation*, the other is *Meditative Reading*. By meditative reading I mean the taking of some truths, either doctrinal or practical—the latter rather than the former—and reading them in this way:—Take the truth which has presented itself to you, and read two or three lines, seeking to enter into the full meaning of the words, and go on no further so long as you find satisfaction in them; leave the place only when it becomes insipid. After that, take another passage, and do the same, not reading more than half a page at once.\n\nIt is not so much from the amount read that we derive profit, as from the manner of reading. Those people who get through so much do not profit from it; the bees can only draw the juice from the flowers by resting on them, not by flying round them. Much reading is more for scholastic than for spiritual science; but in order to derive profit from spiritual books, we should read them in this way; and I am sure that this manner of reading accustoms us gradually to prayer, and gives us a deeper desire for it. The other way is *Meditation*, in which we should engage at a chosen time, and not in the hour given to reading. I think the way to enter into it is this:—After having brought ourselves into the presence of God by a definite act of faith, we should read something substantial, not so much to reason upon it, as to fix the attention, observing that the principal exercise should be the presence of God, and that the subject should rather fix the attention than exercise reason.\n\nThis *faith in the presence of God within our hearts* must lead us to enter within ourselves, collecting our thoughts, and preventing their wandering; this is an effectual way of getting rid of distracting thoughts, and of losing sight of outward things, in order to draw near to God, who can only be found in the secret place of our hearts, which is the *sancta-sanctorum* in which He dwells.\n\nHe has promised that if any one keeps His commandments, He will come to him, and *make His abode* with him (John xiv. 23). St. Augustine reproaches himself for the time he lost through not having sought God at first in this way.\n\nWhen, then, we are thus buried in ourselves, and deeply penetrated with the presence of God within us—when the senses are all drawn from the circumference to the centre, which, though it is not easily accomplished at first, becomes quite natural afterwards—when the soul is thus gathered up within itself, and is sweetly occupied with the truth read, not in reasoning upon it, but in feeding upon it, and exciting the will by the affection rather than the understanding by consideration: the *affection* being thus touched, must be suffered to *repose* sweetly and at peace, *swallowing* what it has tasted.\n\nAs a person who only masticated an excellent meat would not be nourished by it, although he would be sensible of its taste, unless he ceased this movement in order to swallow it; so when the affection is stirred, if we seek continually to stir it, we extinguish its fire, and thus deprive the soul of its nourishment. We must swallow by a *loving repose* (full of respect and confidence) what we have masticated and tasted. This method is very necessary, and would advance the soul in a short time more than any other would do in several years.\n\nBut as I said that the direct and principal exercise should be the *sense of the presence of God*, we must most faithfully *recall the senses* when they wander.\n\nThis is a short and efficacious way of fighting with distractions; because those who endeavour directly to oppose them, irritate and increase them; but by losing ourselves in the thought of a present God, and suffering our thoughts to be drawn to Him, we combat them indirectly, and without thinking of them, but in an effectual manner. And here let me warn beginners not to run from one truth to another, from one subject to another; but to keep themselves to one so long as they feel a taste for it: this is the way to enter deeply into truths, to taste them, and to have them impressed upon us. I say it is difficult at first thus to retire within ourselves, because of the habits, which are natural to us, of being taken up with the outside; but when we are a little accustomed to it, it becomes exceedingly easy; both because we have formed the habit of it, and because God, who only desires to communicate Himself to us, sends us abundant grace, and an experimental sense of His presence, which renders it easy.\n\nLet us apply this method to the Lord’s Prayer. We say “Our Father,” thinking that God is within us, and will indeed be our Father. After having pronounced this word *Father*, we remain a few moments in silence, waiting for this heavenly Father to make known His will to us. Then we ask this King of Glory *to reign* within us, abandoning ourselves to Him, that He may do it, and yielding to Him the right that He has over us. If we feel here an inclination to peace and silence, we should not continue, but remain thus so long as the condition may last; after which we proceed to the second petition, “Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.” We then desire that God may accomplish, in us and by us, all His will; we give up to God our heart and our liberty, that He may dispose of them at His pleasure. Then, seeing that the occupation of the will should be love, we desire to love, and we ask God to give us *His love*. But all this is done quietly, peacefully; and so on with the rest of the prayer.\n\nAt other times we hold ourselves in the position of sheep near to the Shepherd, asking of Him our true food. O Divine Shepherd! Thou feedest Thy sheep with Thine own hand, and Thou art their food from day to day. We may also bring before Him our family desires; but it must all be done with the remembrance by faith of the presence of God within us.\n\nWe can form no imagination of what God is: a lively faith in His presence is sufficient; for we can conceive no image of God, though we may of Christ, regarding Him as crucified, or as a child, or in some other condition, provided that we always seek Him within ourselves.\n\nAt other times we come to Him as to a Physician, bringing our maladies to Him that He may heal them; but always without effort, with a short silence from time to time, that the silence may be mingled with the action, gradually lengthening the silence and shortening the spoken prayer, until at length, as we yield to the operation of God, He gains the supremacy. When the presence of God is given, and the soul begins to taste of silence and repose, this experimental sense of the presence of God introduces it to the second degree of prayer."

			"chaptertext": "SECOND DEGREE OF PRAYER, CALLED HERE “THE PRAYER OF SIMPLICITY.”\n\nThe second degree has been variously termed *Contemplation*, *The Prayer of Silence*, and *of repose*; while others again have called it the *Prayer of Simplicity*; and it is of this last term that I shall make use here, being more appropriate than that of *Contemplation*, which signifies a degree of prayer more advanced than that of which I speak.\n\nAfter a time, as I have said, the soul becomes sensible of a facility in recognising the presence of God; it collects itself more easily; prayer becomes natural and pleasant; it knows that it leads to God; and it perceives the smell of His perfumes.\n\n14Then it must change its method, and observe carefully what I am about to say, without being astonished at its apparent implausibility.\n\nFirst of all, when you bring yourself into the presence of God by faith, remain a short time in an attitude of respectful silence. If from the beginning, in making this act of faith, you are sensible of a little taste of the presence of God, remain as you are without troubling yourself on any subject, and keep that which has been given you, so long as it may remain.\n\nIf it leaves you, excite your will by means of some tender affection, and if you then find that your former state of peace has returned, remain in it. The fire must be blown softly, and as soon as it is lighted, cease to blow it, or you will put it out. It is also necessary that you should go to God, not so much to obtain something from Him, as to please Him, and to do His will; for a servant who only serves his master in proportion to the recompense he receives, is unworthy of any remuneration.\n\nGo, then, to prayer, not only to enjoy God, but 15to be as He wills: this will keep you equal in times of barrenness and in times of abundance; and you will not be dismayed by the repulses of God, nor by His apparent indifference."

			"chaptertext": "ON SPIRITUAL DRYNESS.\n\nAs God’s only desire is to give Himself to the loving soul who desires to seek Him, He often hides Himself in order to arouse it, and compel it to seek Him with love and fidelity. But how does He reward the faithfulness of His beloved! And how are His apparent flights followed by loving caresses!\n\nThe soul imagines that it is a proof of its fidelity and of its increased love that it seeks God with an effort, or that at least such seeking will soon lead to His return.\n\nBut no! This is not the way in this degree. With a loving impatience, with deep humility and abasement, with an affection deep and yet restful, with a respectful silence, you must await the return of your Beloved.\n\n17You will thus show Him that it is *Himself* alone that you love, and His good pleasure, and not the pleasure that you find in loving Him. Therefore it is said, “Make not haste in time of trouble. Cleave unto Him, and depart not away, that thou mayest be increased at thy last end” (Ecclesiastes 2:2-3). Suffer the suspensions and the delays of the visible consolations of God.\n\nBe patient in prayer, even though you should do nothing all your life but wait in patience, with a heart humbled, abandoned, resigned, and content for the return of your Beloved. Oh, excellent prayer! How it moves the heart of God, and obliges Him to return more than anything else!"

			"chaptertext": "ABANDONMENT TO GOD—ITS FRUIT AND ITS IRREVOCABILITY—IN WHAT IT CONSISTS—GOD EXHORTS US TO IT.\n\nIt is here that true *abandonment* and consecration to God should commence, by our being deeply convinced that all which happens to us moment by moment is the will of God, and therefore all that is necessary to us.\n\nThis conviction will render us contented with everything, and will make us see the commonest events in God, and not in the creature.\n\nI beg of you, whoever you may be, who are desirous of giving yourselves to God, not to take yourselves back when once you are given to Him, and to remember that a thing once given away is no longer at your disposal. *Abandonment* is the key to the inner life: he who is thoroughly abandoned will soon be perfect.\n\n19You must, then, hold firmly to your abandonment, without listening to reason or to reflection. A great faith makes a great abandonment; you must trust wholly in God, against hope believing in hope (Rom. iv. 18). *Abandonment* is the casting off of all care of ourselves, to leave ourselves to be guided entirely by God.\n\nAll Christians are exhorted to abandonment, for it is said to all, “Take no thought for the morrow; for your Heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things” (Matt. vi. 32, 34). “In all thy ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct thy paths” (Prov. iii. 6). “Commit thy works unto the Lord, and thy thoughts shall be established” (Prov. xvi. 3). “Commit thy way unto the Lord; trust also in Him; and He shall bring it to pass” (Ps. xxxvii. 5).\n\nAbandonment, then, ought to be an utter leaving of ourselves, both outwardly and inwardly, in the hands of God, forgetting ourselves, and thinking only of God. By this means the heart is kept always free and contented.\n\nPractically it should be a continual loss of our 20own will in the will of God, a renunciation of all natural inclinations, however good they may appear, in order that we may be left free to choose only as God chooses: we should be indifferent to all things, whether temporal or spiritual, for the body or the soul; leaving the past in forgetfulness, the future to providence, and giving the present to God; contented with the present moment, which brings with it God’s eternal will for us; attributing nothing which happens to us to the creature, but seeing all things in God, and regarding them as coming infallibly from His hand, with the exception only of our own sin.\n\nLeave yourselves, then, to be guided by God as He will, whether as regards the inner or the outward life."

			"chaptertext": "OF SUFFERING WHICH MUST BE ACCEPTED AS FROM GOD—ITS FRUITS.\n\nBe content with all the suffering that God may lay upon you. If you will love Him purely, you will be as willing to follow Him to Calvary as to Tabor.\n\nHe must be loved as much on Calvary as on Tabor, since it is there that He makes the greatest manifestation of His love.\n\nDo not act, then, like those people who give themselves at one time, and take themselves back at another. They give themselves to be caressed, and take themselves back when they are crucified; or else they seek for consolation in the creature.\n\nYou can only find consolation in the love of the cross and in complete abandonment. He who has no love for the cross has no love for God (see 22Matt. xvi. 24). It is impossible to love God without loving the cross; and a heart which has learned to love the cross finds sweetness, joy, and pleasure even in the bitterest things. “To the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet” (Prov. xxvii. 7), because it is as hungry for the cross as it is hungry for God.\n\nThe cross gives God, and God gives the cross. Abandonment and the cross go together. As soon as you are sensible that something is repugnant to you which presents itself to you in the light of suffering, abandon yourself at once to God for that very thing, and present yourself as a sacrifice to Him: you will see that, when the cross comes, it will have lost much of its weight, because you will desire it. This will not prevent your being sensible of its weight. Some people imagine that it is not suffering to feel the cross. The feeling of suffering is one of the principal parts of suffering itself. Jesus Himself was willing to suffer it in its intensity.\n\nOften the cross is borne with weakness, at other times with strength: all should be equal in the will of God."

			"chaptertext": "ON MYSTERIES—GOD GIVES THEM HERE IN REALITY.\n\nIt will be objected that, by this way, mysteries will not be made known. It is just the contrary; they are given to the soul in reality. Jesus Christ, to whom it is abandoned, and whom it follows as the *Way*, whom it hears as the *Truth*, and who animates it as the *Life*, impressing Himself upon it, imparts to it His own condition.\n\nTo bear the conditions of Christ is something far greater than merely to consider those conditions. Paul bore the conditions of Christ on his body. “I bear in my body,” he says, “the marks of the Lord Jesus” (Gal. vi. 17). But he does not say that he reasoned about them.\n\nOften Christ gives in this state of abandonment views of His conditions in a striking manner. We must receive equally all the dispositions in which 24He may be pleased to place us, choosing for ourselves to abide near to Him, and to be annihilated before Him, but receiving equally all that He gives us, light or darkness, facility or barrenness, strength or weakness, sweetness or bitterness, temptations or distractions, sorrow, care, uncertainty; none of these things ought to move us.\n\nThere are some persons to whom God is continually revealing His mysteries: let them be faithful to them. But when God sees fit to remove them, let them suffer them to be taken.\n\nOthers are troubled because no mysteries are made known to them: this is needless, since a loving attention to God includes all particular devotion, and that which is united to God alone, by its rest in Him, is instructed in a most excellent manner in all mysteries. He who loves God loves all that is of Him."
